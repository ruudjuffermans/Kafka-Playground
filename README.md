## About The Project

There are many great python resources available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a resource that showcases all the python skills that i know.

Here's why:

- This is a really structured way for me to learn python
- This way im using the official documentation so that I dont only know the common useages of the subjects
- In the end this should result in a resource for others to learn python
